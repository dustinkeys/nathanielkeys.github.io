Beta reader 
Hello! I’m looking for you to read my new novel before anyone else. 

Actual Occasions is literary fiction with a lightly speculative pulse, part historical, part contemporary. Think the interwoven resonance of Cloud Atlas or A Visit from the Goon Squad, but told at the intimate, elastic scale of Rachel Cusk’s autofiction. 

Five strangers in five different eras feel the ground give way beneath them when bridges burn, safe havens disappear, and the same question keeps resurfacing: what do we cling to when the world won’t stay put — memory, myth, or each other?        { 60,000 words }

In 4 weeks, I’ll follow-up with you with specific questions about your experience reading the novel.
